# Advanced Flyway Migration Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced usage of Flyway for managing database migrations. It provides a comprehensive example of schema creation, updates, data manipulation, and performance optimization using SQL scripts. The project is designed to showcase best practices for handling complex database schemas and migrations in a real-world application.

## Features

- **Initial Schema Definition**: Includes creation of tables with constraints, default values, and relationships.
- **Schema Updates**: Shows how to handle schema changes, add new columns, and update existing data with error handling.
- **SQL Techniques**: Demonstrates the use of conditional inserts, triggers, and materialized views for performance optimization.
- **Data Manipulation**: Includes examples of data updates and insertions based on specific conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling in SQL scripts to manage unexpected situations gracefully.

## Migration Scripts

### Initial Schema

- **`V1__initial_schema.sql`**: Establishes the foundational schema with `roles` and `users` tables.

### Schema Updates

- **`V2__update_schema_and_handle_errors.sql`**: Adds columns, updates data, and incorporates error handling.
- **`V3__schema_updates.sql`**: Focuses on indexing, creating materialized views, and implementing triggers with error handling.

### Data Manipulation

- **`V4__data_manipulation.sql`**: Demonstrates how to update and insert data, including advanced SQL features for conditional logic.

## Usage

This project can be used as a reference or template for managing complex database migrations with Flyway. It is particularly useful for understanding advanced SQL techniques and error handling in a migration context.

### Key Components

- **Flyway**: Used for versioned migrations and managing schema changes.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database used in this project.
- **H2**: Used for lightweight, in-memory testing (if applicable).
